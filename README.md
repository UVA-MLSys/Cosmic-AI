AI enhanced solutions for cosmology and astronomy. Following are the current research projects:

## [CAI - Scalable Foundation Model Inference on Cloud](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06249?)

A novel **Cloud-based Astronomy Inference (CAI)** framework for data parallel AI model inference on AWS. We can classify 500K astronomy images using the AstroMAE model in a minute !

## OmniSpectra: A Unified Foundation Model for Native Resolution Astronomical Spectra

The first foundation model to process variable lengths of spectra from arbitrary instruments at their original size/resolution, without resizing or downsampling to a fixed size.
